<h1>What Prediction Markets Actually Measure</h1>

<p>In the weeks leading up to November 5th, 2024, when Donald Trump won the presidential election, prediction markets consistently showed him as the favorite to win. But observers watching multiple platforms would have seen something curious. The same event traded at different prices depending on where you looked. Kalshi showed Trump at 58% probability, Polymarket at 62%, while Iowa Electronic Markets hovered around 55%.</p>

<p>These gaps persisted through election day. Billions in trading volume, sophisticated participants monitoring prices yet the differences remained. One platform operated under CFTC regulatory oversight, another on offshore blockchain infrastructure. The gaps weren't closing.</p>

<p>The standard explanation treats these differences as arbitrage inefficiencies. There exists some true probability that markets collectively discover. Price differences simply reflect the time needed for capital to flow freely enough to eliminate profit opportunities. Wait long enough, gather enough liquidity, and these gaps should close.</p>

<p>That framework misunderstands what prediction markets actually do. These aren't three imperfect measurements of one true probability being discovered through better capital flows. They're three fundamentally different knowledge objects produced by three radically different infrastructures. Prediction markets don't discover pre-existing information about the future. They produce distinct forms of knowledge based on their architectural design. The design determines what can be known.</p>

<p>Understanding what prediction markets actually measure requires looking past surface-level prices to examine the mechanisms producing them. Those mechanisms don't just affect efficiency or liquidity. They constitute what information means in the first place.</p>

<h2>Three Platforms, Three Measurements</h2>

<p>The Iowa Electronic Markets, operated by the University of Iowa's Tippie College of Business since 1988, represents prediction markets in their purest academic form. The exchange runs as a centralized double-auction system where both buyers and sellers post limit orders that a matching engine pairs at equilibrium prices, creating a single market-clearing price for each contract. The platform charges no transaction fees, limits maximum stakes to $500 per trader, and restricts participation to academic researchers and students enrolled in approved institutions. This structure exists because IEM operates as a research project rather than a commercial venture, which allows it to optimize purely for information aggregation without considering revenue models, regulatory compliance costs, or the need to compensate market makers for providing liquidity. When researchers analyze IEM presidential election markets, they consistently find minimal systematic pricing biases relative to eventual outcomes.<span class="footnote">1</span> The prices track polling averages closely and convert efficiently into probability estimates that prove reasonably well-calibrated over time. The platform measures pure probability aggregation under laboratory conditions where the structural forces that might create bias in commercial markets have been deliberately designed away.</p>

<p>Kalshi launched in 2021 as the first CFTC-regulated prediction market exchange in the United States, bringing prediction markets into the commercial mainstream under explicit regulatory oversight. The regulatory approval process took years and required demonstrating that markets would operate with institutional-grade oversight, clear resolution criteria tied to authoritative data sources, and protections against manipulation. This regulatory foundation gives Kalshi something neither academic experiments nor offshore crypto platforms can offer: legal certainty for US institutional capital and the operational legitimacy of mainstream financial infrastructure.</p>

<p>The platform operates using a quote-driven maker-taker market structure familiar to anyone who has traded equities or options on traditional exchanges. Market makers post limit orders on both sides of a contract and wait for counterparties, earning the spread between bid and ask prices when trades execute against their orders. Market takers submit market orders demanding immediate execution, paying the spread as a premium for immediacy rather than waiting for favorable prices. Kalshi charges a percentage-based fee on winning positions calculated as approximately $0.07 multiplied by p(1-p), where p represents the contract price. For a contract trading at 50 cents, this fee works out to about 1.75 cents, or 3.5% of position value. For a contract trading at just 10 cents, the same formula yields 0.63 cents, but because the position size is smaller, that represents 6.3% of your capital at risk.</p>
